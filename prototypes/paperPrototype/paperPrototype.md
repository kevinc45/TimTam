# Paper Prototype
- Our solution is designed to enhance pedestrian safety by encouraging greater attention to road conditions at intersections. The system integrates an interactive game placed on both sides of the street, where pedestrians can engage with one another while waiting to cross.
- The game involves two pedestrians collaborating to complete a recipe by kicking virtual ingredients to one another across the intersection. However, the gameplay is time-limited. Once the allotted time is up—typically when the signal changes—the game will automatically stop, prompting pedestrians to focus on the road and safely navigate the crossing.

## User Flow
1. Each side of the intersection has its own recipe task. To complete the task, players need to collect different ingredients.

2. By kicking ingredients to the other player on the opposite side of the intersection, both players can receive the ingredients they need. Completing the task requires collaboration between the two players.

3. If the task is completed, the screen will show a "yummy" text on the screen.
