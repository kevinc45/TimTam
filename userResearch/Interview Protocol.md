# **DECO3500 TimTam Interview Protocol**

# Introduction

"First, we want to ensure you that the data we're going to collect will be completely anonymous and will be used for the purpose of the research and this particular course's assignment only. I will ask for your occupation and age at the beginning of the interview, but it will only be for addressing purposes inside of our report. We will not write down your name anywhere, even when sharing the interview result with our group members."

"If you feel uncomfortable or do not want to answer at any moment during our interview, it is absolutely fine to tell me to stop right away. You can stop at any time and revoke your participation in our research. We will not push you any further."  
		  
"I would also ask you for permission to record our interview so that I can transcribe it later on before it gets analysed by the team. This also ensures that even your voice will not be shared even among our team members."
