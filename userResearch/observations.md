* ‚Å†People do illegal crossing on the roundabout even though the crosswalk is near.  
* No counting timer for the crosswalk.  
* People walking alone are more likely to use their phones than those walking in groups.  
* Quite a lot of people will cross the road during red lights.  
* People tend to use their phone while waiting to cross.  
* Some people will have their phones in hand and immediately start looking at it when they are about 1 step from the road curb.  
* 5 people used their phones all the way when they were crossing.

### On Unsignalised Crosswalk

* People use their phones less at this unsignalised intersection.
