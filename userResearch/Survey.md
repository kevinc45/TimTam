## Summary
1. We collected 30 reponses from the survey and 90% of them are 18 to 34 years old.
2. Although all participants reported that they use their smartphone when crossing the road in one day, only 40% participants expressed they "rarely" use their phone while crossing.
3. The majority of participants reported using instant messaging apps like WhatsApp and Line (66%), as well as social media apps such as Instagram (70%).
4. The top three primary reasons are convenience (50%), staying connected (36.7%), avoding boredom (26.7%).

## Conclusion
Apparently, most young people have the habit of using smartphones while crossing the road, and we will focus on how to transfer people's attention from their phones. 
Additionally, we found that staying connected and avoiding boredom are the main reasons for smartphone use, which we can focus on when developing solutions to address 
these issues. Therefore, we decided to create a solution that incorporates gamification and collaborative elements to make the experience more fun and interactive.
