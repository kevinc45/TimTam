# Probe Report & Insight

The probe was done on Wednesday, 3 September 2024 (Week 7). The probes were deployed around the UQ Chancellor Place area at 10 in the morning and collected the next day (4/9) at 10 in the morning.

There are two types of probes that we deployed:
- Signalised crosswalk
- Unsignalised crosswalk

## Probe Objectives
There are two different objectives of the probe:
1. Based on <b>which probe has more participations</b>, it can show us which crosswalk get crossed more.
2. Based on the <b>result</b>, it can show us what do people usually do on their phones while crossing the street.

## Probe Questions
> <i>What is the <b>last screen</b> on your phone right now?</i>

## Probe Results

<b>Unsignalised*</b>
- Texting/Chatting: 1
- Web search/Browser: 1
- Maps/Navigation: 1
- Watching videos: 1

<b>Signalised</b>
- Texting/Chatting: 26
- Watching videos: 21
- Web Search/Browser: 5
- Music: 15
- Games: 2
- Maps: 3
- Nothing/Not using phone: 8

*The unsignalised probe was missing the next day, so the data above were taken from a photo taken by one of our members in the late afternoon the day before.

<b>Signalised, at the same time when the unsignalised probe picture was taken</b>
- Texting/Chatting: 10
- Watching videos: 10
- Web Search/Browser: 3
- Music: 8
- Games: 1
- Maps: 2
- Nothing/Not using phone: 4

## Insight

- When people use their smartphone while crossing the road, they mainly use it for social media.
- Even the photos earned earlier show that more people are crossed on the signalised crosswalk than the unsignalised one.
- There is an indication that people used their phones more on the signalised crosswalk than in the unsignalised crosswalk, but this might be due to the incomplete unsignalised crosswalk probe data or because people cross the unsignalised crosswalk less.

## Limitations

- We do not know if the placement of each probe will affect the result for unsignalised vs signalised probes.
- We do not know if this kind of behaviour will remain similar when applied to other crosswalks outside of UQ.
- We do not know the result of the unsignalised one at the end of our observation (because it got taken off).
